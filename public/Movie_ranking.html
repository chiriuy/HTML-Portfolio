 <h1>The Best Movies According to Christian</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
 <p>Great Movie, It's basically Dances with Wolves in Feudal Japan but it just scratches an itch I cannot describe</p>
 <h3>Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
 <p>War, Honor, Sacrifice and Duty. Excellent movie, fits my taste juuust right</p>
 <h3>The Edge of Tomorrow</h3>
 <p>Sci-Fi, good script, good acting and an interesting take on the "alien invaders" trope</p>
